ADAPTIVE RAG SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION

Overview:
The Adaptive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system is an intelligent document retrieval and question-answering system that combines vector search with large language models.

Key Features:
1. Hybrid Search: Combines dense (semantic) and sparse (keyword) search strategies
2. Adaptive Retrieval: Automatically decides when to use retrieval based on query complexity
3. Multi-tenant Support: Isolated namespaces for different use cases
4. Evidence Scoring: Ranks retrieved chunks by relevance and quality
5. Iterative Refinement: Can perform multiple search iterations to improve results

Architecture Components:
- Policy Engine: Decides retrieval strategy (skip, dense, sparse, hybrid)
- Embedder: Converts text to vector representations using sentence transformers
- Vector Store: Stores and retrieves document chunks using FAISS
- Reranker: Re-scores retrieved chunks for better relevance
- Tool Discovery: Semantic tool selection based on user intent

Supported Operations:
- ingest_document: Add documents to the knowledge base
- search: Find relevant information using various search modes
- rerank: Improve search results quality
- cite: Generate citations for retrieved sources
- summarize: Create concise summaries of documents

Performance Metrics:
- Average retrieval time: < 100ms
- Embedding dimension: 384
- Default top-k results: 5
- Maximum iterations: 3

Use Cases:
- Technical documentation search
- Customer support knowledge bases
- Research paper analysis
- Legal document review
- Enterprise knowledge management

Configuration:
The system uses environment variables for API keys and supports both local and Docker deployment. Default port is 8000 for the HTTP REST API.
